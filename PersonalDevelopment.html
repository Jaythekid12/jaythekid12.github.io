		<h2>Summary and Reflection: Chapters 4-7 of "Twelve Pillars"</h2>
		<div class="chapter">
			<p><strong>Chapter 4:</strong>
				This chapter speaks about goal setting and the importance of personal growth.
				Charlie explains that goals give direction and purpose which allows people to focus on what they want to achieve in life.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="reflection">
			<p><strong>Chapter 4 Reflection:</strong> 
				This chapter teaches me the importance of setting goals. Writing your goals for the future
				and planning ahead to meet your goal. Don't just have a goal but also aim for your goal. Don't let others stand in the way of your goals and always push forward. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="chapter">
			<p><strong>Chapter 5:</strong> 
				This chapter speaks about everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity. Your best opportunity are those that align 
				with your goals and you should be what you focus on. Charlie encourages Michael to get into the habit of self education and to
				never stop learning, as this is key to personal development and long term success. Don't just go through the day, get from the day. Don't 
				send your time on urgent things but spend your time on what is important. 
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="reflection">
			<p><strong>Chapter 5 Reflection:</strong>
				This chapter teaches me to focus on my goals and less on things that are urgent. Always be in the mood to learn and develop as a person.
				Don't be stuck in the mindset of "I have bills to pay" and develop the mindset of having a goal that you want to obtain and I must reach this goal.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="chapter">
			<p><strong>Chapter 6:</strong> 
				This chapter speaks to the crowd that you surround yourself with. The people around you have affects on you and have the power to 
				influence your future. Mr. Davis says that you must constantly ask yourself these questions: Who am I around? What effect are they
				having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking?
				And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself the big question: Is that okay?”. These questions goes for every
				person that you interact with on a regular basis.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="reflection">
			<p><strong>Chapter 6 Reflection:</strong> 
				I've learned from this chapter to question those around me. Are they a good influence to my life and
				goals? I should get rid of all of the negative energy and surround myself with helpful and strong minded people in my academic and social life.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="chapter">
			<p><strong>Chapter 7:</strong> 
				This chapter speaks about self education and it's importance. Self-education is what you teach yourself. It is what you
				learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. Most people don’t continue to learn or grow,
				so the very fact that you are doing so means you are well on your way to improving your life. If someone is going down the wrong
				path education will help turn them back. Books are one of the most important learning tool in human history. Learning is the beginning
				of wealth, health and spirituality. One book every week will lead you to be more knowledgeableable.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div class="reflection">
			<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> 
				This chapter teaches me that self education is as important as school teaching. Reading books and doing reseach on topics I don't understand 
				will help me grow as a person.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="reflection">
			<p><strong>How could I apply what I read to my life:</strong>
				Chapter four to seven speaks about important subjects that I should adapt in my life. Setting clear goals by writing it and breaking
				it down step by step. I should also track my progress and see how I can stay on track to achieve my goals. Surrounding myself with
				positive influence, prioritize my health and never stop learning.
