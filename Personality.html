			<h2>My Strongest Trait: Perseverance</h2>
			<p>
				My strongest trait is perseverance and it has greatly impacted my academic life and my way of thinking. 
				Whether it's taking on challenging assignments, getting ready for tests or efficiently managing my time, 
				I'm dedicated to conquering any obstacles that arise in my academic life. 
				This trait has helped me maintain high grades, complete assignments on time, stay focused even when things
				get tough and most importantly never give up. 
				Playing video games and reading are two of my favorite hobbies that help's me to stay focused. Taking a quick break from
				a tedious assignment keeps my mind clear and ready to tackle any assignment I'm stuck on.

			<h2>Favorite Quote: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs</h2>

			</div>
			<p>
				This quote resonates alot with me because of not only the quote but also the time and place it was said. Steve Jobs, the 
				co-founder of Apple, was giving a speach at Stanford Univerity where he shared his life story and the challeges he faced 
				in his life. The quote speaks to loving what you do and not to do what you don't like because it will lead to your downfall.
				When you love what you do nothing can stop you from pushing the boundaries limiting creativity and innovation. 
				I strive to apply this mindset not only to my academic life but also other aspects of my life. Rest in peace my hero,
				I hope i will be able to follow in your foot steps and create something great for the world to enjoy.

			<h2>Personality Assessment</h2>
			<p>
				After taking the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test, I was categorized as A guardian. This result suggests
				that I tend to be dutiful, cautious, humble and focused on credentials and traditions. It also states that guardians
				are the cornerstone of society and are trustworthy with the skills needed to keep things running smoothly.Â

			<h3>Reflection on Test Validity</h3>
			<p>

				I find the result of my test accurate even though I don't like to admit it. When I ask other if this is how i am they tell
				me that's how I am. Even though I don't believe that these test are very accurate, your answers can change depending on your
				state of mind but if you sit down and take your time to answer each question somewhat accurately then the result will speak to 
				you.
